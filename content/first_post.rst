:summary: My first post on my new blog

I'm starting a blog. I've had it in the back of my mind to start one for a while,
but I've always thought I would write blog software first. Well, that put up
a pretty big speed bump to blogging, so I'm using a Python blog platform
called Pelican, which is working out pretty well. It generates static pages, so
it's pretty easy to host anywhere and doesn't need a whole lot of infrastructure
like a database.

I'm hoping to share some thoughts about technology and life. I hope to maybe talk
about local issues, since I don't think those represented a whole lot in a way
that feels both fair and comprehensive. We'll see though.

One big hope for this blog is to provide something useful. I might be able to share
something that was useful to me and maybe it will be useful for someone else.
