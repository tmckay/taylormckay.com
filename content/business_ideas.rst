Ideas are cheap and execution is everything. Here is a list of my business ideas.

Contractor Consultants
======================

Connect knowledgable skilled workers as consultants. Navigating a home project is
very challenging, especially when you don't have any expertise in the area. What
happens is a hit and miss approach to hiring a contractor and results that
can miss the mark.

This service would allow skilled people to get paid as consultants on a project.
They would be a completely independent voice that would help provide high level
guidance about what to do and how to approach a problem. You could probably
charge $50/hour for this service, since the cost of home projects is high, so
getting expert advice would be worthwhile and could potentially help save
thousands.

We could find individuals retiring from skilled trades or individuals that are
temporarily unable to do the typical work because of injury or sickness.

How would a typical interaction go?
-----------------------------------

A user would have a project that they want to know more about. They would
take pictures of the project and provide as much of a description as possible.
An expert would review possible questions and choose ones that interest them.
They would schedule a time for the consultation that fits both schedules. Once
in a session, you would have a set amount of time to discuss based on how much
the customers want to pay or expect to pay.

One benefit is that most contractors don't feel like they're getting paid to
chat with their customer and they might be concerned that it will create more
work for them and make their job harder. So most contractors try to have
the minimum amount of conversations, because they're ultimately not being
paid to chat. People hiring contractors sense the same reluctance to chat
and inform, and are maybe unwilling to push the conversation. With this service
people would be paid just to chat, so everyone's incentives are aligned.

What makes this better?
-----------------------

One of the key things will be ratings that help great consultants get the
recognition for their work and charge even more for it. It builds
credibility and would help people find experts in particular areas. It would
be possible to match individuals seeking expertise with their region, project
type and possibly price points i.e. the quality level of the project.

Challenges
----------

Individuals that are skilled with construction might not be as comfortable
on a video chat as they are on a job site. Recruiting talented experts and
getting them set up with quality audio and video might be challenging. One
key piece to this is that most people have mobile phones that are able
to make video calls.
