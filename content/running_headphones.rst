:summary: Experience searching for running headphones 

During the pandemic, I started working from home and a couple months
in, I realized I needed to make plans to get out of the house
everday or else I would be in my home most of the day and not see the
outside. Prior to working from home, I had plenty or reasons to get outside
and walk: I walked to the bus, I walked from the bus stop to my office, I
walked to lunch, and then did all of that in reverse to get home. I realized
I was missing that outdoor time and needed to find another reason to get
outside. That's when I decided to take up running.

My first few runs, I didn't have much gear. I did have some old running shoes
and headphones, but to listen to music I had to pack my iPhone in my pocket.
I ended up buying an Apple Watch, so I didn't have to pack mny iPhone, but
my headphones didn't play nice with my new watch. I decided to get a new pair
and tried lots of different headphones. With most of the headphones, staying
in my ears was a big issue. Nearly all of them fell out. I watched lots of
review videos on YouTube and was surprised that most of them recommended these
headphones. I very quickly learned that they didn't stay put. Eventually, I landed
on the Powerbeats Pro from Beats. They are a great pair of headphones for
running.

I'll add a list of the other headphones that I tried later.
